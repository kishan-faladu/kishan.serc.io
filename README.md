I used HTML, CSS and Javascript with Bootstrap to create this website. It is a multiple page website. You can naigate between the 6 available sections by clicking the respective one on navigation bar(Home, People, Publication, Focus Areas, Resourses, Contact) which will redirect to the particular page. 
Clicking on Admin mode will allow you to edit website data which can be reset by reloading the page.
